Hi. 

You can call me Pitri. I'm working on the problem of industrial defect classification when the amount of data available is not very large. That's why I'm using latest developments in few-shot learning to solve the problem. On the side, I'm working on NLP projects and learning big data & MLOps.

When I'm not doing the above things, I read books and write poetry and fiction.
